#Problem Statement/ Opportunity*

Lack of access to quality healthcare is a major problem in many parts of the world.
This is especially true for rural and underserved communities.
As a result, people in these communities often have to travel long distances to see a doctor, or they may not be able to afford healthcare at all.

This project would create a mobile healthcare clinic that would travel to rural and underserved communities.
The clinic would provide basic healthcare services, such as checkups, vaccinations, and treatment for common illnesses.
The clinic would also provide education and outreach services to help people understand their health and how to stay healthy.
